## Overview

> *Note: This is the original repository of the artifact for SNHU CS340 Client/Server Development 21EW3 computer science course. For the enhancement repository and fully operational mobile application visit the [ePortfolio - Databases Category](https://arsari.github.io/ePortfolio/#databases "Arturo Santiago-Rivera - ePortfolio Databases Category")*

A web application that work with existing database from animal shelters to identify and categorize available dogs to train for different types of rescue, such as water rescue, mountain or wilderness rescue, locating humans after a disaster, or finding a specific human by tracking their scent. The application helps to interact with and visualize individual dog profiles to train from a MongoDB database.

Through a user-friendly, intuitive client-facing web application dashboard, the user reduces errors and training time. The software design pattern used for this multi-tier application is the Model View Controller (MVC). Additionally, a RESTful protocol is used for extending the HTTP protocol to give an application programming interface (API).

This web application demonstrates our competencies to apply database systems concepts using a non-relational database like MongoDB and principles in developing a client/server application based on Python programming language, libraries, and framework. Demonstrates our understanding to develop client-side code that interfaces with databases.

## Reflection

Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable cannot be determined by ourselves easily because, as the authors, we know more than the code says by itself. A maintainable program is clear and straightforward to read the code and which it's understood at a basic level of what the code is doing to include inputs, outputs, and algorithms. It must be easy to understand the software (how it works, what it does, and why it does it the way it does), easy to find what needs to be changed, easy to make changes, and easy to check that the changes have not introduced any bugs.

To achieve this, your peers are the criticism to confirm that your program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. They, like you, are immersed in knowing the whys and hows source codes should work and their solutions. Good code reflects your peer group's current understanding of it. Both will find themselves wading through code, trying to figure out how it all fits together.

A maintainable, readable, and adaptable program brings the advantage of simplified your development process and allows concentrating on other components of your program. Reduce the repetitiveness of components that serves as a union between the server and the user. Releasing a maintainable program during our project's lifetime, we might get other developers fixing bugs or making extensions that we don't have time to do.

As a computer scientist, one of the essential skills is analyzing and solving a problem based on their data structure and architecture. Problem-solving is the process of identifying a problem, developing an algorithm for the identified problem, and finally implementing the algorithm to develop a computer program. It is critical to be absolutely and positively sure that the problem is understood before attempting a solution. Computers are used to solve various day-to-day problems, so problem-solving is an essential skill that computer science should know. Solving a problem depends on how correctly and precisely we define the problem, design a solution (algorithm) and implement the solution (program) using a programming language.

Computer scientists use technology to solve problems by writing coding statements to create maintainable, readable, and adaptable applications. Their primary focus is to validate and develop models for interaction between people and computers or software and devices. They create new theories around technology development. Computer scientists think through ideas on how to take that technology to the next level in sustainable and efficient ways. With the primary objectives to validate and develop mathematical models capable of computer interaction between people and other computers, companies can benefit from identifying a problem, developing an algorithm, and implementing an algorithm that will improve their work gratefully.
